## Repository Context And Integration



## Gitinore file usage

how many repositories will be used to separate submissions

## Credentials storage
Personal credentials will not be displayed on github as this is a collaborative envirnment and personal information should not be shared with the collaborators in my projects. 
Disabling forking will be of great benefit as i would not want other people making changes or taking some of my work. Usage of Github teams and two-factor authentication will be handy.
