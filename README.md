## Repository Context And Integration



## .Gitinore file usage
The gitinore file will be used 


## storage of credentials and sensitive information
Personal credentials will not be displayed on github as this is a collaborative envirnment and personal information should not be shared with the collaborators in my projects. I will use git-credential-store to keep all my passwords. And nomally files like passwords and API keys (credentials)
can be always be stored in the .gitignore.

<br />For further Security of my Github account:
Disabling forking will be of great benefit as i would not want other people making changes or taking some of my work. Usage of Github teams and two-factor authentication will be handy.
